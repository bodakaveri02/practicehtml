  <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1> 
  <p>Hello everyone,
I am Kaveri, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), and I am in my 3rd year. I have a keen interest in technology and enjoy learning about programming, software development, and emerging trends in the tech world.

I am familiar with programming languages like C, Java, and Python, and I have also worked on some small projects related to web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I always try to improve my technical and problem-solving skills by participating in practical assignments and coding activities.

Apart from academics, I have a variety of hobbies that help me relax and stay creative. My hobbies include listening to music, drawing, watching inspirational videos, and exploring new things on the internet related to my field. These activities keep me motivated and curious to learn more every day.</p>
